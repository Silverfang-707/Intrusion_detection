This is a very basic intrusion detection Machine Learning Model that uses the very basic of information gathering and machine learning to detect if there is any abnormal IP that has been connected to the network.

This project consist of a single python file which does 3 functions simultaneously, them being:
  i)generate_csv:
    This function generates a csv file that consists of IP addresses and their respective Loads, Bytes Sent, Bytes Received, Packets sent, Packets Received, Memory used and disk used by the system with the respective ip.
  ii)run_ml_model:
    This function takes the output csv file generated by the generate_csv function to train a Machine Learning Model powered by tensorflow to predit if any of the ip addresses in the csv file seems abnormal and stores the output data in a separate csv file.
  iii)summarize_abnormal_loads:
    This function gets the output file generated by the run_ml_model and counts the number of times every ip has been found to be abnormal and summarizes it into a single text file which is the final output of the program(It can be improved).

Finally an infinite while loop is deployed to repeat the functions over and over again to generate new data which in turn increases the accuracy of the model and makes it produce more accurate results.

Improvements that can be done:
i)The final output can be made to be deleted (after being backed up) from the main location so that the inaccurate results that have been produced during the start of the execution does not affect the more accurate data that will be produced afterwards.
ii)More types of data regarding the factor that distinguishes an abnormal network can be added to improve the model's accuracy.
iii)A function to interrupt the program can be added so that the user does not have to depend on keyboard interrupt to abruptly stop the program.
